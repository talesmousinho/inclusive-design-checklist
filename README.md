# Inclusive Web Design Checklist

Aims to be the **biggest** checklist of inclusive design considerations for the web _ever_. Includes items for accessibility, performance, device support, interoperability, and language. Pull requests welcome! Please add to the `checklist.json` file.

- [ ] Minify CSS and JS, and remove unused/redundant code [Resource #1](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/MinifyResources)
- [ ] Maintain terse HTML, without over-reliance on `<div>` scaffolding
- [ ] Use screen reader and keyboard accessible HTML [Resource #1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML)

- [ ] Ensure states (pressed, expanded, invalid, etc) are communicated to assistive software
- [ ] Match semantics to behavior for assistive technology users
- [ ] Provide a default language and use `lang="[ISO code]"` for subsections in different languages
- [ ] Make controls look like controls; give them strong perceived affordance
- [ ] Underline links — at least in body copy
- [ ] Make sure all content belongs to a landmark element (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc)
- [ ] Avoid pure white or pure black shades
- [ ] Mark invalid fields clearly and provide associated error messages
- [ ] Ensure content is not obscured through zooming (no fixed widths)
- [ ] Provide a `manifest.json` file for identifiable homescreen entries
- [ ] Indicate swipe gesture support clearly, and provide simple tap-based alternatives
- [ ] Make sure data tables wider than their container can be scrolled horizontally
- [ ] Avoid time constraints where possible; provide a clear warning and option to extend where not possible
- [ ] Label and describe the same things with the same terminology
- [ ] Ensure disabled controls are not focusable
- [ ] Do not instate 'infinite scroll' by default; provide buttons to load more items
- [ ] [Avoid justified body text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F88.html)
- [ ] [Provide enough spacing between lines of text (`line-height`)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C21.html)
- [ ] Don't make line widths unreasonably long.

- [ ] [Avoid all-caps text](https://github.com/humanmade/hm-pattern-library/issues/75)

- [ ] Provide descriptive captions for figures
- [ ] Warn users of links that have unusual behaviors, like linking off-site, or loading a new tab
- [ ] Make content easier to find and improve search results with structured data [Resource #1](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/prototype)
- [ ] Use textual labels to make voice activation cues obvious
- [ ] Do not mark up subheadings/straplines with separate heading elements
- [ ] Ensure primary calls to action are easy to recognize and reach
- [ ] Avoid images of text — text that cannot be translated, selected, or understood by assistive tech
- [ ] Provide a print stylesheet (single column, with interactive content hidden)
- [ ] Use well-established, therefore recognizable, icons and symbols
- [ ] Subset fonts to just the characters needed
- [ ] Instead of obstructing users with CAPTCHAs, use [honeypots [Resource #1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing))
- [ ] Begin long, multi-section documents with a table of contents
- [ ] Don"t make users perform actions to reveal content unless completely necessary
- [ ] If content is meant to be hidden, ensure it is properly hidden to all users
- [ ] Make sure controls within hidden content are not focusable
- [ ] Use `srcset` to tailor images to devices and reduce bandwidth costs
- [ ] Do not auto focus form fields, on page load
- [ ] Break up long and complex forms into discrete sections and/or screens
- [ ] Make forms as short as possible; offer shortcuts like autocompleting the address using the postcode
- [ ] Ensure the same content is available across different devices and platforms
- [ ] Inform the user when there are important changes to the application state
- [ ] Make sure the purpose of a link is clearly described — "read more" vs. "read more about accessibility"
- [ ] Avoid drag and drop actions, which can be frustrating for elderly and mobility impaired users.
